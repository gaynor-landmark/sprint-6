Personal Site Design

What is your sites primary purpose?
  My site must show off my skills as a web developer.  Any visitor should feel confident that I know what I am doing. It must also show my learning journey at EDA in both a professional, and a personal sense.  I would like it to allow others an insight into my personality and purpose.

Who is your primary audience?
  Potential employers?

How do you want visitors to interact with your site? What experience do you want them to have?
  I would like visitors to find the experience both enjoyable and informative.  If I can get them to engage with 'me' through the site, then I believe I will have succeeded ie they are interested enough to do more than just give it a quick glance.  I think that it should be easy and interesting to read. 

What will you do to make your page accessible?
  Markup MUST be well-structured.  All images wil be well-described in alt text. Colour contrasts will be checked.  Aria roles will be used. Clear link design.


How will you make your page useable?
  Repsonsive design is extremely important.  No tiny fonts and buttons that are too small to click on.  Clear design layout - plenty of whitespace - informative headings - interesting pictures.
  Cross-browser compatibility. Keep a watch on performance. Page load times - must be under 10secs. 
  Clearly designated homepage and clear navigation structure so visitors know where they are.
